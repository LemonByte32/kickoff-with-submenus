# Kickoff with submenus

A fork of kickoff (found at https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-desktop/-/tree/master/applets/kickoff) with one extra feature: the option of enabling submenus. 

Due to user complaints about "fiddly navigation", submenus where not shown anymore. But instead of making it possible to just disable it, the feature was removed all together (see: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=443742). This fork fixes that. Due to the way the feature is introduced, no changes in the layout where needed.
